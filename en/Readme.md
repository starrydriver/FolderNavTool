# Folder Quick Navigation Tool
## Current Status
ðŸš§ To be completed
## Development History
**April 9**  
ðŸ”¥ Basic functionality completed, now in preliminary use.

**April 3 - April 4**  
ðŸ”¥ Tried everything but couldn't hide the horizontal scrollbar.  
Faced with the stubborn scrollbar issue in a lightweight app of just a few hundred KB, it was exhausting.  
ðŸŒ™ Switched frameworks overnight.  
Migrated to the Avalonia framework overnight.  
Then spent half a day wrestling with the MVVM architecture.  
ðŸŽ‰ Final Outcome  
Successfully completed the UI interface reconstruction.  
Interactive functionality remains at a standstill. ðŸ˜†
